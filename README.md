MetaProxy
=========

A Minecraft Proxy Server designed for cross server teleportation

NOTE:
I would love some help on this project! However, I would like to set some guidelines:
- All indentations should be two (2) spaces.
- Form follows function. Let's get this thing running first, then we can complain about coding style.
- Speed is of the essence. I would like this to be able to handle 100+ players at a time without bogging down the system.
